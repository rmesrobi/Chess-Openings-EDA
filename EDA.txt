The purpose of this document is to summarize the findings and questions that arose during my EDA.


Questions:
1. How does activity and inactivity effect gameplay? 
Does inactivity effect lower ranked players more than higher ranked players?
2. Model the distribution of the elo rating across the unique players or across time?




Findings:
1. moves column will need to be manipulated into an array or dictionary
2. Elo rating system - theoretical mean of 1500 with a standard deviation of 200
3. Create skill groups - beginner, novice, and experts - maybe more buckets?
4. Use novice group as control group? Investigate memory, problem solving, 
decision making, pattern recognition, and object recognition.
5. Performance of groups to other groups when encountering the Einstellung effect


Cleaning:
1. Remove duplicate ids
df_1 = df.drop_duplicates(subset = ['id'])
2. Create list of moves
df.moves = df.moves.apply(lambda x: x.split(' '))
3. Create game category (rapid, blitz, bullet)
4. Create rating category

Plan for Tuesday:
1. win percentage
2. aggregate by opening
3. aggregate by first 5 moves
4. think of 3-5 hypothesis tests that i could do (focus on 2-3)
5. 1 visualization of the chess board - final piece placement or openings
6. Hypo - correlation between 1st and 2nd move between rating categories
