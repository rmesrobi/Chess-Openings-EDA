# Proposal 2: Houston Astros

## Summary
Pitch by pitch event data for Houston Astros between 2016 - 2020. Potentially include video technology data of pitch movement to determine true advantage. Quantify the effects of stealing signs on batter / team performance. Determine the win / loss outcome from cheating.

Note: Retrosheet data is massive and looks difficult to load and digest. This proposal might be better for Capstone 2.
